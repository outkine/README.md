Hello! I'd love to share a bit more about my pinned projects üòÅ
 * **Robot Rumble** is an AI competition website that became my pandemic project. The logic repo contains the code that simulates robot battles and determines their results.
 * My first programming experience was a 2000 LOC single-file platformer that I wrote in Python during high school. **Ascension Rust** was my attempt to recreate it with, well, Rust.
 * **pico-kit** is a collection of useful lua functions that I put together for the PICO-8 game engine/console. Most of these came out of a coding club I ran in high school.
 * **Chicago-Traveler** was my first web-enabled project in which I attempted to make a train/bus tracker for the CTA.
 * **ChessEngine** is a Python "chess engine" that uses brute force to calculate moves. It beats the easiest AI on lichess!
